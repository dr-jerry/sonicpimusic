[Sonic Pi](http://sonic-pi.net/) is an application for scripting music, available on Raspberry PI, Mac OS and [Windows] (https://twitter.com/samaaron/status/1246228442250706945)

For my birthday I've scripted my own langzalikleven.rub, You can copy the contents and paste it into Sonic PI or you can run it 
with 

    run_file "/your/path/to/langzalikleven.rub"
	
And press run.

More information on Google and a very nice [Dutch tutorial] (https://coderdojo-leiden.github.io/)
